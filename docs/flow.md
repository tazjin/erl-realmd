WoW login flow and packets
==========================

## Packets and other stuff

Some packets and structs that exist. Not all of these might be needed/relevant
for a POC.

```c++
enum eStatus
{
    STATUS_CONNECTED = 0,
    STATUS_AUTHED
};

enum AccountFlags
{
    ACCOUNT_FLAG_GM         = 0x00000001,
    ACCOUNT_FLAG_TRIAL      = 0x00000008,
    ACCOUNT_FLAG_PROPASS    = 0x00800000,
};

typedef struct AUTH_LOGON_CHALLENGE_C
{
    uint8   cmd;
    uint8   error;
    uint16  size;
    uint8   gamename[4];
    uint8   version1;
    uint8   version2;
    uint8   version3;
    uint16  build;
    uint8   platform[4];
    uint8   os[4];
    uint8   country[4];
    uint32  timezone_bias;
    uint32  ip;
    uint8   I_len;
    uint8   I[1];
} sAuthLogonChallenge_C;

typedef struct AUTH_LOGON_PROOF_C
{
    uint8   cmd;
    uint8   A[32];
    uint8   M1[20];
    uint8   crc_hash[20];
    uint8   number_of_keys;
    uint8   securityFlags;                                  // 0x00-0x04
} sAuthLogonProof_C;

typedef struct AUTH_LOGON_PROOF_S
{
    uint8   cmd;
    uint8   error;
    uint8   M2[20];
    uint32  accountFlags;                                   // see enum AccountFlags
    uint32  surveyId;                                       // SurveyId
    uint16  unkFlags;                                       // some flags (AccountMsgAvailable = 0x01)
} sAuthLogonProof_S;

typedef struct AUTH_LOGON_PROOF_S_BUILD_6005
{
    uint8   cmd;
    uint8   error;
    uint8   M2[20];
    // uint32  unk1;
    uint32  unk2;
    // uint16  unk3;
} sAuthLogonProof_S_BUILD_6005;

typedef struct AUTH_RECONNECT_PROOF_C
{
    uint8   cmd;
    uint8   R1[16];
    uint8   R2[20];
    uint8   R3[20];
    uint8   number_of_keys;
} sAuthReconnectProof_C;

typedef struct XFER_INIT
{
    uint8 cmd;                                              // XFER_INITIATE
    uint8 fileNameLen;                                      // strlen(fileName);
    uint8 fileName[5];                                      // fileName[fileNameLen]
    uint64 file_size;                                       // file size (bytes)
    uint8 md5[MD5_DIGEST_LENGTH];                           // MD5
} XFER_INIT;

```

## Handlers

Several different commands are handled:

```c++
const AuthHandler table[] =
{
    { CMD_AUTH_LOGON_CHALLENGE,     STATUS_CONNECTED, &AuthSocket::_HandleLogonChallenge    },
    { CMD_AUTH_LOGON_PROOF,         STATUS_CONNECTED, &AuthSocket::_HandleLogonProof        },
    { CMD_AUTH_RECONNECT_CHALLENGE, STATUS_CONNECTED, &AuthSocket::_HandleReconnectChallenge},
    { CMD_AUTH_RECONNECT_PROOF,     STATUS_CONNECTED, &AuthSocket::_HandleReconnectProof    },
    { CMD_REALM_LIST,               STATUS_AUTHED,    &AuthSocket::_HandleRealmList         },
    { CMD_XFER_ACCEPT,              STATUS_CONNECTED, &AuthSocket::_HandleXferAccept        },
    { CMD_XFER_RESUME,              STATUS_CONNECTED, &AuthSocket::_HandleXferResume        },
    { CMD_XFER_CANCEL,              STATUS_CONNECTED, &AuthSocket::_HandleXferCancel        }
    };

enum eAuthCmd
{
    CMD_AUTH_LOGON_CHALLENGE        = 0x00,
    CMD_AUTH_LOGON_PROOF            = 0x01,
    CMD_AUTH_RECONNECT_CHALLENGE    = 0x02,
    CMD_AUTH_RECONNECT_PROOF        = 0x03,
    CMD_REALM_LIST                  = 0x10,
    CMD_XFER_INITIATE               = 0x30,
    CMD_XFER_DATA                   = 0x31,
    // these opcodes no longer exist in currently supported client
    CMD_XFER_ACCEPT                 = 0x32,
    CMD_XFER_RESUME                 = 0x33,
    CMD_XFER_CANCEL                 = 0x34
};

```

## Results

We can send different result codes based on what's happening

```c++
enum AuthResult
{
    WOW_SUCCESS                     = 0x00,
    WOW_FAIL_UNKNOWN0               = 0x01,                 ///< ? Unable to connect
    WOW_FAIL_UNKNOWN1               = 0x02,                 ///< ? Unable to connect
    WOW_FAIL_BANNED                 = 0x03,                 ///< This <game> account has been closed and is no longer available for use. Please go to <site>/banned.html for further information.
    WOW_FAIL_UNKNOWN_ACCOUNT        = 0x04,                 ///< The information you have entered is not valid. Please check the spelling of the account name and password. If you need help in retrieving a lost or stolen password, see <site> for more information
    WOW_FAIL_INCORRECT_PASSWORD     = 0x05,                 ///< The information you have entered is not valid. Please check the spelling of the account name and password. If you need help in retrieving a lost or stolen password, see <site> for more information
    // client reject next login attempts after this error, so in code used WOW_FAIL_UNKNOWN_ACCOUNT for both cases
    WOW_FAIL_ALREADY_ONLINE         = 0x06,                 ///< This account is already logged into <game>. Please check the spelling and try again.
    WOW_FAIL_NO_TIME                = 0x07,                 ///< You have used up your prepaid time for this account. Please purchase more to continue playing
    WOW_FAIL_DB_BUSY                = 0x08,                 ///< Could not log in to <game> at this time. Please try again later.
    WOW_FAIL_VERSION_INVALID        = 0x09,                 ///< Unable to validate game version. This may be caused by file corruption or interference of another program. Please visit <site> for more information and possible solutions to this issue.
    WOW_FAIL_VERSION_UPDATE         = 0x0A,                 ///< Downloading
    WOW_FAIL_INVALID_SERVER         = 0x0B,                 ///< Unable to connect
    WOW_FAIL_SUSPENDED              = 0x0C,                 ///< This <game> account has been temporarily suspended. Please go to <site>/banned.html for further information
    WOW_FAIL_FAIL_NOACCESS          = 0x0D,                 ///< Unable to connect
    WOW_SUCCESS_SURVEY              = 0x0E,                 ///< Connected.
    WOW_FAIL_PARENTCONTROL          = 0x0F,                 ///< Access to this account has been blocked by parental controls. Your settings may be changed in your account preferences at <site>
    WOW_FAIL_LOCKED_ENFORCED        = 0x10,                 ///< You have applied a lock to your account. You can change your locked status by calling your account lock phone number.
    WOW_FAIL_TRIAL_ENDED            = 0x11,                 ///< Your trial subscription has expired. Please visit <site> to upgrade your account.
    WOW_FAIL_USE_BATTLENET          = 0x12                  ///< WOW_FAIL_OTHER This account is now attached to a Battle.net account. Please login with your Battle.net account email address and password.
};
